# ResearchDataAnalysis
This repository contains code which automates the analysis process for my research project. It extracts the raw data from the .cvs files produced by the testing instrument. I paste the data into a template excel file. Another part of the data comes from an image with a width measurement. I used OpenCV to filter the image and Tessearct to find the values. It contains the code, sample .cvs, and picutres to run the code. All the files need to run this code are in fulltest folder.
